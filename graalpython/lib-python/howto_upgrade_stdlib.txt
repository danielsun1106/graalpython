Process for upgrading the stdlib to a new cpython version
==========================================================

... note: very similar to PyPy's process

1. check out the branch lib-python3
2. remove lib-python/3
3. copy the files from the pypy repo at the py3.x tip
4. git commit -m "import pypy hg:$(cd $PYPYDIR; hg sum | head -1 | cut -f2 -d' ')"
5. check out the branch to merge into
6. merge lib-python/3
7. follow process for integration
